          "If all <strong>astronomical</strong>processes cease, how will the passage of time manifest itself? It is doubtful if vacuum <strong>fluctuations</strong> can provide a clock for the recording of time. Will time itself come to a stop? Is this a meaningful question? <strong>Such questions are difficult to answer</strong>.
